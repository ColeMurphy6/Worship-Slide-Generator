# Worship-Slide-Generator
Generates a PowerPoint slide with a video background and overlayed lyrics using animation to reveal each one at a time.

Run worshipSlideGenerator.pyw with a video (titled "video.mp4") and a text file with lyrics (titled "lyrics.txt") in the same directory. Make sure the "pptDB" folder is a folder in the same directory as the script as well. It will extract the lyrics from the text file, split them using the delimeter "$", and make a copy of a slideshow with the same number of text boxes as there are lyric sections from pptDB, changing out the placeholder text and video.
