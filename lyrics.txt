I'm walking on sunshine, whoa oh oh
$
Isn't she lovely? Isn't she wonderful?
$
I just want to dance the night away
$
Take me to the moon, let me play among the stars
$
You say goodbye, I say hello
$
I want it that way
$
Don't stop believin'
$
I've got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
$
Every little thing she does is magic
$
Cause baby, you're a firework
$
Just a small-town girl, living in a lonely world
$
I will survive, oh as long as I know how to love
$
Hit me with your best shot
$
I wanna dance with somebody
$
Imagine all the people, living life in peace
$
I’m yours
$
We don’t talk anymore
$
No matter what we do, we can't hide the way we feel
$
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
$
I’m a survivor, I’m not gonna give up
